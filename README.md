# RevShell
*A python tool to automatically craft reverse shells from the [TamperMonkey Cheat Sheet](http://pentestmonkey.net/cheat-sheet/shells/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet)*

## How to use
Download the repo using either the *Download* button, or cloning into the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TikvahTerminator/RevShell.git
```
Once the files are downloaded, traverse into the directory
```bash
cd RevShell
```
Then, simply run with python!
```bash
python3 RevShell.py
```
The program is pretty self explanatory from here, simply select a shell, choose your IP/Port and voila!

## ...Why?

*I was sick of having to constantly go to the site and manually make the shells okay...*
## What shells can it craft?

 - PHP (output to a file in the current working directory)
 - Python
 - PERL
 - Ruby
 - Netcat
 - Bash

I plan on adding more when i find them as i go along! :)
